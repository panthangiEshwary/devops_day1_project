1️⃣ Workflow name
name: Run DevOps Script


This is just a friendly name for your workflow.

You’ll see this name in the GitHub Actions UI when the workflow runs.

2️⃣ When the workflow runs
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:


on: tells GitHub when to trigger this workflow.

push: → runs when you push code to the repository.

branches: - main → only runs when you push to the main branch.

pull_request: → runs when a pull request is opened or updated.
So basically, your script runs on push to main and pull requests.

3️⃣ Jobs
jobs:
  run-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest


jobs: → defines one or more tasks (jobs) that the workflow will run.

run-script: → the ID of this job (you can call it anything).

runs-on: ubuntu-latest → the job runs on a fresh Ubuntu Linux virtual machine provided by GitHub.

4️⃣ Steps
steps:


A job has multiple steps that run in order.

Step 1: Checkout repository
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v3


uses: actions/checkout@v3 → this is a prebuilt GitHub Action.

It clones your repository into the VM so the workflow can access your files.

Without this, the VM won’t have your hello_devops.sh file.

Step 2: Make script executable
- name: Make script executable
  run: chmod +x hello_devops.sh


run: → runs a shell command on the VM.

chmod +x hello_devops.sh → makes your shell script executable, just like chmod +x on your local machine.

Step 3: Run the script
- name: Run the script
  run: ./hello_devops.sh


This actually runs your shell script.

Whatever your script prints (like "Hello DevOps!") will appear in the GitHub Actions log.

✅ Summary:

This workflow triggers on push to main or pull request.

It runs on an Ubuntu VM.

It checks out your code, makes the script executable, and then runs it.
